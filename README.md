# Breast-Cancer

Dataset recorded the measurements on Breast Cancer cases. The breast cancer cases are classified into Benign or Malignant tumours.
Thus, this is a binary classification. We aims to utilize the dataset and build ML algorithms for predicting whether the cases are Benign or Malignant tumours.

Objective: Perform classification on the Breast Cancer dataset using different machine learning algorithms.

Selection of ML algorithms:
1. k-Nearest Neighbours 
2. Logistic Regression
3. Support Vectors Machine 

Acknowlegment: Dataset is available and downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository.
