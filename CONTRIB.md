We have chosen three machine learning models and have distributed for the focus on the project as the following: 

•	Tee Kar Men: K-Nearest Neighbour

•	Nuraini Muhammad Naim: Logistic Regression

•	Lee Zi Sheng: Support Vector Machine

All results and discussion are presented in the 'finalreport'.
